# News Scraper

This is an ongoing project aimed at developing a versatile news scraper capable of extracting content from various news websites. The project focuses on creating tools to simplify the process of setting up scraper and filter rules.

## Notes
As this project is currently under development, most or all features are still being implemented. The Python Eel library is being used for creating the graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Although this might not be the most optimal choice, it can be modified in the future. The project also utilises vanilla JavaScript and CSS for front-end development.

The project is divided into four main components:

* Link Scraping
* Article Scraping
* Processing, Analysis, and API Integration
* Front-End Development
Currently, the project is in the initial phase, focusing on link scraping.
